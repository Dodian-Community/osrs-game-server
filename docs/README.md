# Dodian Monorepo Documentation
This will house all the documentation in one easy to find location. Dodian's Monorepo contains the applications revolving around the game itself (excluding client).

**Why not client included in monorepo?** \
Honestly simply because RuneLite repository is so big, and the deployment pipeline would be different. *Although not to say in the future it wouldn't be included here sa well.*
